            Hi there, this is<s>TMI</s>my life story:
        </h1>

        <ul class="timeline">
            <li class="event">
              <h3>Birth 🐣</h3>
              <p>I was born in 1995 in Subang Jaya during the Chinese New Year. It certainly wasn't the most enjoyable CNY for my mom. </p>
            </li>

                <h3>Growing up in a small town 🛝</h3>
                <img src="./img/baby.jpg">
                <p>My grandma took care of me from a baby until I was seven in a small Johor town. I was a talkative, cheeky, and imaginative child. My hobby was to scribble and sketch on any clean surface, which was a huge trouble.</p>
              </li>

            <h3>Primary School Years 🐵</h3>
            <img src="./img/childhood.jpg">
            <p>I continued wreaking havoc (jk) after my parents brought me to Selangor to start my primary schooling. I further developed my passion in drawing by creating my comic series, which became a hit among my peers, but the teachers didn't like that students were secretly reading the comic books during classes.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="event">
                <h3>Secondary School Years 🎻</h3>
                <p>I mellowed out in my teen years. I had fun learning karate and playing violin. Fun fact: I was forced to learn classical music when I was young. Since I didn't enjoy piano, I opted for violin and ended up liking it a lot.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>College Life ⛄🍺🧀</h3>
                <img src="./img/grad-photo.jpg">
                <p>I enrolled in the American Degree Programme at Taylor's University. Later, I was accepted to the University of Wisconsin Madison, US, to major in Political Science and Economics. I was probably the only Malaysian studying Polsci in that school. I was introduced to the campus party scene, developed cheese and milk addictions, and adjusted to the cold &#40;wearing summer clothes in 15°C weather, hmm&#41;.</p>

                <h3>Adulting: Connecting the dots👩🏻‍💼</h3>
                <p>I joined Sigma School for a career change to web development in my late twenties.   
                <br/>
                <p>While I enjoyed my previous roles, I realized that I was way more interested in the dev team's tasks. I self-learned coding for a while before enrolling in Sigma School.</p>
